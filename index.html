<!-- 	<h2>The EMBL-EBI ontology tools and services for data annotation </h2> -->
	<p> Welcome to the Ontology Tooling page of the Samples Phenotypes and Ontologies Team. 
	Here you will find different tools to help you discover, develop and search ontologies,
	along with tools to help you annotate your data with ontologies. If you are new to these concepts,
	please visit the FAQ page.
	</p>
	<p> But why should you annotate your data with ontologies?
	The main reason to do this is to give semantics to your data. This goes a long 
	way as it will make your data easier to visualize, easier to query in a meaningful way, 
	and easier to integrate with other data. 
	</p>
	<p> Let's try and answer some basic questions with our ontology tools.
